-- FUNCTION: simulate_new_sale(p_invoice_date TIMESTAMP)
-- =============================================================================
--
-- DESCRIPTION:
--   Simulates the creation of a single, complete sales transaction.
--   This function is designed to be called repeatedly by an external script
--   to generate synthetic sales data. It ensures data integrity by
--   encapsulating the entire sale creation process within a single function.
--
-- PARAMETERS:
--   p_invoice_date (TIMESTAMP): The exact timestamp to be used for the new
--                               invoice. This allows the calling script to
--                               control the temporal distribution of sales.
--
-- RETURNS:
--   TABLE(generated_invoice_id INT, generated_total NUMERIC):
--     - generated_invoice_id: The ID of the newly created invoice.
--     - generated_total: The final calculated total for the invoice.
--
-- LOGIC:
--   1. Selects a random customer from the "Customer" table.
--   2. Determines the next available "InvoiceId" sequentially.
--   3. Inserts a new record into the "Invoice" table with a placeholder total.
--   4. Randomly decides on a number of items for the invoice (1 to 5).
--   5. Iteratively adds unique tracks to the "InvoiceLine" table, ensuring
--      no duplicate tracks are in the same invoice.
--   6. Accumulates the total price from the selected tracks.
--   7. Updates the "Invoice" record with the correct, final total.
--   8. Returns the new invoice ID and its total for logging purposes.
